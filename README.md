# AndroidTodoApp
This is a sample TODO application.
It has the ability to:
1) Add an item to the list
2) Edit item in the list
3) Store the item list in a file and load upon launch

Know issues:
1) If you create a multiline item, when app reloads this list from the file, each line appears as a seperate item.

Use sqlLite
Fix above bug
